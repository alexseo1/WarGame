# WarGame
the traditional war card game
War is a card game where a deck of 52 cards is shuffled, half the deck is dealt to one player and the other half to the other.
Then, each player takes turns drawing a card.
The player with the highest ranking card gets to add the other playerâ€™s card to their hand.
The game ends when one player has less than ten cards (or runs out of cards)

If the two cards are the same rank, then it is "War". each player has to wager three cards, and then draw again.
The player with the highest ranking card then gets to keep all of the wagered cards.
